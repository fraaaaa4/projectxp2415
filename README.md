Hello, and welcome to the repository or Project 2415. This projecct is being worked on by me, and TechGuy's TechSpot & Games#3732, and aims at bringing back the look of Windows Whistler build 2415 into 2428, the closest leaked build we have. The project aims at editing all parts of the OS, from the login screen down to the build tag on the desktop.

This project is also one of the firsts providing custom themes to a beta build like 2428. Additionally, in the release you can find also a second theme, originally probably not included within 2415, but based on the Luna concept mockups.

If you have any problem or questions, feel free to contact me here in Issues on Github!
