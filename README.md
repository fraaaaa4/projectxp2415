Bringing back the look of Whistler build 2415 in Whistler 2428.


Hello, and welcome to the repository or Project 2415. This little project is nothing serious, and just aims at bringing back the XP 2415 look in Whistler 2428, the closest we have to 2415.

Build 2415 has been unleaked, and is still unleaked. This little collection of modified files, if substituted in an original copy of 2428, makes it have a convincing 2415 look.
